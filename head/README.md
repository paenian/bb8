# bb8
Trying to make a printed BB8 that's strong, fast and accurate.

## Head
- ball rollers on the head underside
- magnets on head & stalk in shell for motion
  - the hamster section will handle head motion
- todo: electronics inside?  Controllable?

#Progress:
Basically none.  When the ball's rolling I'll work on the head.
