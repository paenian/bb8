# bb8
Trying to make a printed BB8 that's strong, fast and accurate.

## Hamster
This will contain the design files for the robot - 3d printed parts, mostly.
The code will live in the code folder.

Right now, I have 80mm omniwheels hooked attached to 25mm, 300rpm gearmotors.
I don't think the motors are strong enough, or fast enough; but swapping them out
will happen once I get the electronics to function a bit.

Wheels and motors came from HobbyKing.

I plan to do a 4-wheel omniwheel bot, so I need to figure out suspension to keep all four wheels on the ball.

#PROGRESS:
Designed a motor adapter for motors I probably won't end up using.

Progress here will be entwined with the electronics.  It'd be nice to have 'em mounted.

#TODO:
- Platform - lasercut maybe?  Need a base to mount everything to.
  - ...and then mount stuff to the base.
- Connectors for the motors
- motor leveling.
