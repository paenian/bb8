# Thermoformed Body
Trying to make a printed BB8 that's strong, fast and accurate.

The body here contains the hamster as well - they are integrated.

##Size and Shape
Two endcaps, roughly 300mm around, and six petals.

Changing from 6 to 8 or 4 is trivial.

The endcaps print flat, and have integrated drive gears; the gears are large, and help to move the motors towards the edge, helping with weight distribution.

I plan to have some of the endcap panels open up - so you can reach in and charge the battery.  Not sure if I can make them big enough, what with the gear in the way... removing the petals will be possible, but require a bunch of screws.

The parts are sized to fit on my 600x300x300mm printer - I'll also try to make halved parts to fit on a 300x300, for the petals at least.



The main drive uses two or four of these: https://www.pololu.com/product/1102

I plan to still use the Dagu 4-motor shield; given the weight of BB8 I'm thinking of using all four drivers for the axle motors.

Turning will be accomplished by swinging a central weight with servos.

Spinning will be accomplished by rapidly spooling up and down the turning weight.


##Milestones
1. Endcaps connected & motors attached.
  * This means a mockup of all the innards.
  * This will literally be a robot to move forwards and backwards.
2. Xbee communication - run the axle motors.
  * Simple remote control.
  * I want to get this in early :-)
  * Also means I need to design a controller.
3. Tilt control
  * from now on, all these things include RC control of the bit.
4. Petals printed/thermoformed
5. Head printing
6. Head motion
  * X, Y and Spin
7. Head noises
  * noises are cool
8. Spin-in-place
9. Lights on the body?
10. Paint it
