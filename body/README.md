# bb8 body
Trying to make a printed BB8 that's strong, fast and accurate.

## Shell
Transitioning to a printed shell with an axle drive - designed for a large-format printer.  Old shell has been moved to the rhombicuboctahedron directory - it is complete, and forms a nice, strong shell - but getting a hamster to roll around inside of it and stabilized is rough.  There's so much slip!

##Thermoformer
I'm gaining access to a thermoformer - so planning on making an axle-drive bot with printed endcaps that hold sector-shaped thermoformed panels - making a lightweight sphere.  I'll print the form, of course, and a panel or two so it can still be made with a printer.
