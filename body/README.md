# bb8 body
Trying to make a printed BB8 that's strong, fast and accurate.

## Shell
One screw per joint seemed too weak - and the inserted washers weren't helping.
So I moved to two screws per joint.  Those files are in the 'assembled2' and 'printing2' directories.

###Printing
- I'm printing with four walls, and 6 top/bottom layers
- .2mm layers
- I've got a .4mm nozzle on this printer
- The parts fit in a 180mm cube if you rotate them 45 degrees.
  - should fit on most printers :-)
- It takes 12 hours to print a square on my machine: http://nova-labs.org/wiki/novai3

###Parts and Tools
You'll need:
- all 26 printed parts.
  - 18 squares
  - 8 triangles
- 48 M4x16mm socket-cap screws
- 48 M4 square nuts
  - I ordered from from McMaster Carr: mcmaster.com
- 48 1/4" by 1/4" by 1/2" magnets, magnetized along the long axis.
  - I ordered from K&J Magnetics: https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=B448
- A SHORT ball-end hex key
  - I used just a right-angly guy; my T-handled was too long.

###Assembly
- The first 8 parts, numbered 0-7, form a flat ring.  They should go together easy, two screws per part.
  - For professional styling, the two screws per edge should be going in opposite directions.
- The next 6 form the vertical ring
- The final 4 fill in the last ring.
  - Use the assembled parts to make sure you put the panels in the right spot!
- Lastly, the triangles fill in, using magnets.
  - I glued them in with silicone, on both the squares and the triangles.
  - Triangles should pop right in - but they haven't been tested yet.

#Progress/TODO:
- I'm printing up the shell now.
- no planned updates.
- The only question is how well the magnets can hold the triangles on.
